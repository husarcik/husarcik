- 👋 Hi, I’m Eddie a diagnostic radiology resident! It is very nice to meet you. 
- 👀 I’m interested in radiology and medical education.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to speed up my coding workflow with CI/CD and learn more about e2e/unit testing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tutoring systems, mainly spaced repetition.
